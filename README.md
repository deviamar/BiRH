# BiRH
Bio-inspired Robotic Hand (BiRH) is a personal research project exploring simplified design and dexterous manipulation.

Inspired by the versatility of the human hand, I began with the question: How is the human hand so effective at grasping a wide range of objects, and how can we design a robotic hand that is _simpler_ but still quite _effective_?

This project evolved through visualization, thought experiments, simulations in MuJoCo, 3D-printed physical prototypes, and discussions with researchers in robotics and dexterous manipulation.

In this repository, you'll find:
 - MuJoCo XML models and Python scripts
 - 3D CAD designs across multiple iterations
 - Grasp test photos and insights
 - A slideshow and written reflections on my design journey

This is a work-in-progress archive and portfolio of everything Iâ€™ve learned and continue to build along the way.
